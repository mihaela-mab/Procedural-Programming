# Message Encryption / Decryption and Pattern Recognition
This project combined two problems of cryptography and digital processing, more exactly encryption and decryption of a message (particularized in this project to images) and pattern recognition (particularized to handwritten digits).
The programming language used is C and the image format is BMP (bitmap). For the pattern recognition module, I used the "template matching" method.
